# Bonobo ETL Pipeline APIs
A repository containing the methods and scripts used to maintain various databases. The repo contains various APIs for setting up and executing small-scale ETL pipelines using the [Bonobo](https://github.com/python-bonobo) library.

The library was designed mainly for specific personal use but is generalizable. It was built with ease of use and simplicity at all costs as such it is very light weight. Use Airflow or something else if you have specific needs please.
